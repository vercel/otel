## ðŸ“– API Reference

### `registerOTel(serviceName: string)`

Registers the OpenTelemetry SDK with the specified service name and the default configuration.

- `serviceName`: The name of your service, used as the app name in many OpenTelemetry backends.

### `registerOTel(config: Configuration)`

Registers the OpenTelemetry SDK with the specified configuration. Configuration options include:

- `serviceName`: The name of your service, used as the app name in many OpenTelemetry backends.
- `attributes`: The resource attributes. By default, `@vercel/otel` configures relevant Vercel attributes based on [the environment](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables), such as `vercel.env`, `vercel.runtime`, `vercel.host`, etc.
- `instrumentations`: A set of instrumentations. By default, `@vercel/otel` configures "fetch" instrumentation.
- `instrumentationConfig`: Customize configuration for predefined instrumentations, such as "fetch".
- `propagators`: A set of propagators that may extend inbound and outbound contexts. By default, `@vercel/otel` configures [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) propagator.
- `traceSampler`: The sampler to be used to decide which requests should be traced. By default, all requests are traced. This option can be changed to, for instance, only trace 1% of all requests.
- `spanProcessors` and `traceExporter`: The export mechanism for traces. By default, `@vercel/otel` configures the best export mechanism for the environment. For instance, if a [tracing integrations](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/otel-overview/quickstart) is configured on Vercel, this integration will be automatically used for export; otherwise an [OTLP exporter](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/#otlp-exporter) can be used if configured in environment variables.
